# Mechanic Recommendations

A web application that generates recommendations for car repairs based on the user's input.

This web application that allows users to input their car make, model, year, and issue description, and receive personalized recommendations for resolving their issue. The recommendations are generated by a machine learning model that was trained on a dataset of car repair information.

The app was built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It also makes use of the Fetch API for making network requests to the backend server, and the Next.js framework for server-rendering the React components on the page.
